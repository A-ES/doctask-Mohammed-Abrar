# Invariants

## Checkpointed Resumability

These invariants are absolute — violations are treated as system bugs, never acceptable trade-offs.

1. **Never re-run a completed node's side effects on resume.** When a run is
   resumed after a crash, nodes whose checkpoint has been durably written must
   NOT execute again. The system skips directly to the next un-checkpointed
   node. Re-execution could cause duplicate writes, duplicate API calls, or
   data corruption.

2. **Never lose an in-flight decision.** If a human reviewer submits an
   approval/rejection decision, that decision must be durable before the
   pipeline acknowledges it. A crash after acknowledgement but before
   checkpoint must not discard the decision — the decision is the
   authoritative record, and the pipeline must recover it on resume.

3. **Never leave a run in an ambiguous state if killed between two node
   transitions.** At any instant, a run is in exactly one of:
   - The last checkpointed node completed, next node has not started.
   - A node is actively running (its `run_steps` row has status='running',
     ended_at=NULL).

   On resume, any row with status='running' and ended_at=NULL is marked
   'failed' (orphan cleanup) before determining the restart point. There is
   no window where two nodes appear simultaneously "in progress" for the
   same run, and no window where it is unclear which node should run next.

## Concurrent Run Isolation

4. **Never interleave writes between concurrent runs in a way that corrupts
   either run's state.** Two runs against the same document pile — whether
   they are different piles or the same pile hit twice — must execute with
   full isolation. Specifically:

   - Each run's `run_steps` rows are scoped by `run_id`. A checkpoint write
     for run A must never overwrite, duplicate, or interleave with run B's
     checkpoint rows.
   - Shared mutable state (e.g. document status columns, claim records) must
     be protected by per-run_id advisory locks so that concurrent runs
     serialize access to any shared row.
   - On completion, each run must contain exactly the set of results it
     produced — no duplicates from the other run, no missing entries caused
     by a lost update.

   The implementation uses per-run_id scoping (all store operations filter
   on `run_id`) combined with threading locks on the store to prevent
   data races. In production Postgres, this maps to row-level locking via
   `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or advisory locks per run_id.

## Approval Gate Isolation

5. **Approving or rejecting one queue item must never discard or corrupt
   other items in the same batch.** The approval queue holds pending items
   (findings, conflicts, proposed updates) tied to a `run_id`. Each item
   is decided independently:

   - Rejecting item X has zero effect on item Y's committed state.
   - Approving item Y does not modify, delete, or change the status of
     any other item in the queue.
   - Decisions are atomic per-item: a decision write either fully succeeds
     (status transitions from 'pending' to 'approved'/'rejected', decision
     row is recorded) or fully fails (item remains 'pending'). There is no
     partial state.
   - The queue must be drivable programmatically (REST endpoint), not only
     via UI. A program must be able to approve/reject items without human
     interaction.

## Document Piles

9. **Documents belong to a pile.** Every document in the system is associated
   with exactly one pile via the `pile_documents` junction table. A pile is
   the unit of work handed to a pipeline run — it groups related documents
   (e.g. a loan application package) so they are processed together.

10. **A run is started against a pile (and a playbook).** The `runs` table
    carries an explicit `pile_id` foreign key. The pipeline processes all
    documents in the pile at run-start time. This is the canonical way to
    tell the system "these documents go together."

11. **New documents can be added to an existing pile later; this does not
    automatically rewrite previous run results.** Adding a document to a pile
    after a run has completed (or while one is in progress) does NOT
    retroactively modify that run's checkpoints, findings, or decisions.
    A new run must be started explicitly to incorporate the new document.

12. **Two concurrent runs against the same pile must not corrupt each other.**
    This extends invariant 4. Per-run_id advisory locks already protect
    checkpoint writes. The pile's document list is read at run-start time
    and treated as immutable for the duration of that run — concurrent
    additions to the pile are invisible to an in-flight run.

## Finding Integrity (Rules Checking Stage)

13. **Findings are produced if and only if a rule evaluation returns verdict
    "fail".** The rules checking stage never pads, forces, or synthesizes
    findings. Specifically:

    - A Finding is produced only when `verdict == "fail"`. Verdicts of
      `pass`, `not_applicable`, or `insufficient_evidence` never produce
      findings.
    - When no rules are violated, the findings list is empty — never
      populated with synthetic entries.
    - Every Finding carries the exact source span (start_offset, end_offset,
      text) that triggered the violation. Offsets are absolute positions in
      the original document.
    - Every Finding records the evaluation_method ("llm" or "structured")
      that produced it.

14. **Adding a compliance rule never requires modifying Python source files.**
    New rules are added by editing YAML playbook files under `rules/`. The
    pipeline evaluates any rule present in a valid playbook without code
    changes. This is validated by test (`test_extensibility.py`).

15. **Rule evaluation errors are correctly classified.** LLM API failures
    produce transient errors (retryable). Unknown playbook IDs or invalid
    YAML produce permanent errors (stop immediately). Zero applicable rules
    or zero source spans produce empty findings with status "completed" — 
    never an error state.
