"""Deliverable model with section-level hashing for incremental updates.

A Deliverable represents the assembled output of the pipeline — a structured
collection of sections, each backed by one or more claims. Sections are
independently hashable, enabling byte-identity verification after incremental
updates: sections unaffected by a new document must have identical hashes
before and after the update.

Design:
- Each section has a stable key (e.g., "loan_agreement.interest_rate").
- Section content is the canonical serialized form of its claims.
- Section hash is SHA-256 of the canonical content bytes.
- The full deliverable hash is the SHA-256 of all section hashes concatenated
  in sorted key order.
